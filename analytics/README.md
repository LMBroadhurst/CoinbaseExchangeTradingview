# Analytics
- python 3.12 windows x64

## analytics_venv
- .gitignore the venv.
- Add a requirements.txt file for all used libraries
- Never move a venv after creation. It messes with the paths.

```bash
python -m venv analytics_venv

# Installs
pip install numpy
```

## Ideas and Goals
- Look into #mahi-labs channel and checkout what Dave posted
    - Market Microstructure: How can I analyse this and produce a model?
    - e.g. if OB on one side breaches 1mil in 5 layers, take sells. If not in profit within 4Hrs close position.

- Yield profile kind of metrics on trades
    - ...
