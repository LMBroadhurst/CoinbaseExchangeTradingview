Dashboard displaying financial data for major stocks.
Ability to compare across sectors, indexes, etc.
News stories/sentiment/etc.

## MVP Idea 1
- Create an API that downloads and stores financial data daily
- API call into XYZ, ideally grabbing a load of data
- Store that data into local SQL
- Perform BE calculations on data to produce a richer set
- Create endpoints that will allow that data to be gathered

# Crypto

- Download data from last x months.
- Save into file.
- Mark specific points that would be considered to be a buy or sell. If price ends with 1 to begin.
- Represent that graphically.
