# Memory in Java: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-memory-management/
Though the GC handles garbage collection of non essential objects in Java, there are cases where memory management knowledge are beneficial.

## JVM Memory Structure
JVM defines run time data ares which are used during program execution.
Some created by the JVM and some by the threads used in the JVM.
- Memory area created by the JVM is only destroyed once the JVM program exits.
- Thread areas are destroyed when the thread exits.

JVM memory structure is made up of 5 parts:
1. Heap Area
2. Method Area
3. JVM Stack
4. Native Method Stack (NMS)
5. PC Registers
