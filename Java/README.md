# What is the goal of this JavaQuant package?
1. I want to improve my ability to write and read Java code. Go further into Generics, threading, DTOs, etc.
2. Understand the intricacies of OOP languages more. How do they run, previously 
started a spring package and just let the spring runner take control. How does it
work without that spring runner.
3. Create something genuinely useful or at least interesting. If I'm lucky, actually profitable.
